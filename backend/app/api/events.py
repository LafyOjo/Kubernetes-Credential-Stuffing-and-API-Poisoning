# This router exposes endpoints for reading system events.
# Events are things like logins, alerts, or other activity 
# tracked in the DB so that the dashboard can visualize 
# whatâ€™s happening in real-time or historically.
#
# The routes here are protected by authentication, so only
# logged-in users can request events. We also optionally 
# filter by time (last X hours).

# Parameters:

#
# Security:
#   - Requires a valid authenticated user (via get_current_user).
#
# This is what powers the "Events" table in the frontend.
