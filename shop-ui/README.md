# Demo Shop UI

This directory contains a self-contained HTML/JavaScript demo that showcases a credential stuffing attack on a shopping cart application. No backend server is requiredâ€”the page can be opened directly in a browser.

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the demo. You can:

- Browse sample products and manage a cart
- Log in manually as **alice** or **bob** with `password123`
- Trigger a simulated credential stuffing attack using the **Simulate Credential Stuffing Attack** button
- View compromised user profile details and order history once logged in

The demo uses in-memory data to highlight how an attacker can gain access to a user's account and view private information.
