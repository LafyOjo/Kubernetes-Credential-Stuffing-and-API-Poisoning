# This module defines the /score endpoint and related helpers.
# Its job is to track login attempts, raise alerts when 
# failures stack up, and block abusive clients (e.g. bots 
# doing credential stuffing). 
#
# It integrates with Prometheus (for metrics), the database 
# (to store alerts), and the in-memory FAILED_USER_ATTEMPTS 
# dict (for quick per-user rate limiting).
