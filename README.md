# APIShield+ Demo

This repository contains a small FastAPI service used to detect credential stuffing attempts and a React dashboard for viewing alerts.

## For final project dissertation Use Only

This project is intended for testing security concepts in controlled environments
for educational purposes. Attacking systems without explicit authorization is
strictly prohibited. The RockYou‑derived password list included under
`scripts/data/rockyou.txt` is provided solely as a demonstration resource.

## Configuration

The backend reads environment variables from a `.env` file on startup. The
`SECRET_KEY` must be set; otherwise `backend/app/core/security.py` raises an
error during import. Several optional variables control features such as
credential stuffing thresholds, debug logging, forwarding to the Demo Shop,
anomaly detection, and enforcing a zero‑trust API key:

- `FAIL_LIMIT` – how many failures are allowed within the window before
  blocking a client (default `5`).
- `FAIL_WINDOW_SECONDS` – the size of the window in seconds used when counting
  failures (default `60`).
- `DB_ECHO` – set to `true` to log SQL statements (default `false`).
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` – lifetime of issued JWT tokens in minutes
  (default `30`).
- `REGISTER_WITH_DEMOSHOP` – set to `true` to also register the account with Demo Shop (default `false`).
- `LOGIN_WITH_DEMOSHOP` – set to `true` to also log into Demo Shop when authenticating (default `false`).
- `DEMO_SHOP_URL` – base URL for Demo Shop when forwarding registrations (default `http://localhost:3005`).
- `ANOMALY_DETECTION` – set to `true` to enable ML-based request anomaly checks (default `false`).
- `ANOMALY_MODEL` – algorithm used when anomaly detection is enabled. Choose
  `isolation_forest` or `lof` (default `lof`).
- `REAUTH_PER_REQUEST` – set to `true` to require the user's password on every API call (default `false`).
- `ZERO_TRUST_API_KEY` – if set, every request must include this value in the
  `X-API-Key` header. Invalid keys are logged via `/score` and show up in
  Prometheus metrics.
- All API calls are recorded. Retrieve them via `/api/access-logs`. Non-admin
  users only see their own history.

A sample `backend/.env.example` file includes all of these optional settings
with sensible defaults. Copy it to `.env` so your `.env` starts with all
variables defined, then adjust values as needed.

When enabled, clients must supply the password again via the
`X-Reauth-Password` header. The dashboard automatically prompts for
the password whenever the API replies with `401` and then retries the
request. Enter the same password you used to log in. If you cancel or
enter it incorrectly, you will be logged out and returned to the login
screen. The helper script `scripts/reauth_client.py` demonstrates
prompting for the password before each request when calling the API
from the command line.

To try it manually, register an account and then run:


`X-Reauth-Password` header. The helper script
`scripts/reauth_client.py` demonstrates prompting for the password
before each request.

To try it manually, register an account and then run:


```bash
python scripts/reauth_client.py alice --base http://localhost:8001 --times 2
```

The script logs in and prompts for your password before every request.
Canceling the prompt or entering the wrong password logs you out and
returns to the login screen. Set `REAUTH_PER_REQUEST=false` in `.env` if
you prefer to disable this extra check.



Example `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
SECRET_KEY=super-secret-key
# Optional tuning parameters
FAIL_LIMIT=5
FAIL_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
DB_ECHO=true
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REGISTER_WITH_DEMOSHOP=true
LOGIN_WITH_DEMOSHOP=true
DEMO_SHOP_URL=http://localhost:3005
ANOMALY_DETECTION=true
# Algorithm for anomaly detection
ANOMALY_MODEL=lof
# Require password on every API request
REAUTH_PER_REQUEST=false
ZERO_TRUST_API_KEY=demo-key
```

## Running the backend

1. Create and activate a virtual environment and install the requirements:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate always check because sometimes some operating systems may save this in the libs/bin folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Packages are pinned to versions that ship wheels for Python 3.12. If
# installation fails with compiler errors, make sure build tools such as
# a C compiler and Rust are available.
```

2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`. The example includes all
   optional variables shown below, so your `.env` should match it unless you
   change values.

3. Run Alembic migrations to create the `alerts` table:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
**Note:** If `app.db` already exists from a previous run, `alembic upgrade head` may fail. Remove the file or run `alembic stamp head` before rerunning the upgrade.

4. Load the variables from `.env` and start the API server:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Prometheus metrics will be exposed at `http://localhost:8001/metrics`.

### Resetting alerts during testing

The detector blocks clients once they exceed `FAIL_LIMIT` within
`FAIL_WINDOW_SECONDS`. During local testing you can either raise these values
in `.env` or wipe existing alert records. Updating the limits requires
restarting the server so the new environment variables are loaded.

To clear all alerts from the default SQLite database:

```bash
sqlite3 app.db "DELETE FROM alerts;"
```

The next request starts with a clean slate.

## Running the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8001 npm start
```

The dashboard reads the `REACT_APP_API_BASE` environment variable to locate the
backend API. Setting it as shown above causes `apiFetch('/login')` to expand to
`http://127.0.0.1:8001/login`. You may also place this value in `frontend/.env`.
Set `REACT_APP_API_KEY` if the backend requires an `X-API-Key` header.

The React application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Generating Data for the Dashboard

The admin dashboard is designed to display security alerts, primarily from credential stuffing attacks. After a fresh installation, the dashboard will be empty because no security events have occurred yet.

To populate the dashboard with data, you can simulate an attack using the provided script.

1.  **Ensure the backend is running:**
    ```bash
    # From the 'backend' directory
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
    ```

2.  **Run the credential stuffing script:** This script will attempt to log in as "alice" using a list of common passwords. These failed attempts will trigger alerts that appear on the dashboard.

    ```bash
    # From the project's root directory
    python scripts/stuffing.py --username alice --passwords-file scripts/data/rockyou.txt
    ```

3.  **Refresh the Admin Dashboard:** Log in as your admin user (`alice_admin`). You should now see alerts and statistics related to the simulated attack.

## Starting the Demo Shop

The demo shop sources are located in the `demo-shop/` directory.
To run the shop locally execute:

```bash
cd demo-shop
npm install
npm start
```

The API will be available on <http://localhost:3005> by default. When the
server starts your default browser opens the shop home page automatically at
<http://localhost:3005/>.

## Credential Stuffing Simulation

1. Start the React application:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   The dashboard will be served at <http://localhost:3000>.

   The dashboard shows two demo accounts, **Alice** and **Ben**. Selecting an
   account displays how secure it is as a progress bar and lists the enabled
   protections. Alice intentionally has reduced security while Ben has all
   security features enabled. When a login succeeds the simulator fetches the
  user's cart from Demo Shop, demonstrating how Alice's data is exposed while
  Ben remains safe.

   The attack simulator also provisions example policies through the API. It
   creates a lenient policy for Alice and a strict one for Ben using
   `POST /api/policies` and assigns them to each user via
   `POST /api/users/{username}/policy/{policy_id}`. This setup shows how
   different policy settings affect the outcome of the demo.


2. Log in and locate the **Credential Stuffing Simulation** section. Choose a
   target account and click **Start Attack**. When targeting Alice the attack
   will usually succeed quickly. Ben's account requires the correct chain token
   so repeated guesses are blocked.

3. To use the command-line to login and create a user that would be used across the services and for the 
   purpose of testing we need to use the terminal, below is an example of how to register a user and login
   
   ``
   `
  $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"alice","password":"secret"}'

  $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"ben","password":"ILikeN1G3R!A##?"}'
  ```
   After registering with the detector service, send the same credentials to
   Demo Shop so both backends share the account:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"alice","password":"secret"}'

  curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"ben","password":"ILikeN1G3R!A##?"}'
   ```
  and to login we would either login from the react-native application or we would enter in the command below

   ```
   $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/login
   -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   -d '{"username": "alice", "password": "secret"}'
   ```
   The response contains a JWT access token. Include it in the `Authorization`
   header when calling protected endpoints or when logging out:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/logout \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```
   
For command-line testing there are three standalone scripts:

```bash
python scripts/reauth_client.py --help
python scripts/stuffing.py --help
python scripts/stuffingwithjwt.py --help
```
Both scripts accept `--score-base`, `--shop-url`, `--api-key`, and `--chain-url` (defaults to `/api/security/chain`) to override the default addresses (`http://localhost:8001` for the detector API and `http://localhost:3005` for the Demo Shop UI).


`stuffing.py` performs a basic credential stuffing attack against the insecure
login endpoint. The `stuffingwithjwt.py` variant targets the JWT-protected API
and illustrates how using token-based authentication blocks the attack.

The password list at `scripts/data/rockyou.txt` is derived from the widely
circulated RockYou breach dataset. It is provided in this repository solely for
demonstration purposes and no license or ownership is claimed.

## Running with Kubernetes

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

### Steps

1. Spin up a local cluster to run the detector service:

   ```bash
   bash infra/kind/up.sh
   ```

   The script creates a kind cluster and installs Prometheus and Grafana. Start
   the demo shop separately with:

   ```bash
   cd demo-shop
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```

   The Node service listens on port `3005` and requires the password on each API
   call via the `X-Reauth-Password` header.

2. Generate a certificate and create the TLS secret. The repository does not
   include `server.key` or `server.crt`, so run the script below to create them
   locally before making the Kubernetes secret:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/generate-cert.sh
   kubectl create secret tls detector-tls \
       --cert=server.crt --key=server.key -n demo
   ```

3. Create a Secret containing the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic detector-env \
       --from-literal=SECRET_KEY=<random-secret> \
       --from-literal=DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db \
       --from-literal=ZERO_TRUST_API_KEY=demo-key \
       --from-literal=ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8001,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3005 \
       -n demo
   ```
   Ensure `ALLOW_ORIGINS` includes the demo-shop port (`http://localhost:3005`) so the UI can reach the API.

   Replace `<random-secret>` with any string you want to use as the secret key.
4. Build the detector image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t detector:latest -f backend/Dockerfile backend
   ```

5. Load the image into the kind cluster so the Deployment can pull it:

   ```bash
   kind load docker-image detector:latest --name cred-demo
   ```

   If the image isn't loaded before applying the manifests, the detector pod will
   remain in the `Pending` state. Check its status with:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n demo
   ```

6. Deploy the Kubernetes manifests:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/
   ```

7. Access the services using port-forwarding (in separate terminals):

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/front-end -n demo-shop 3005:80   -> open 'http://localhost:3005' in your browser to view the Demo Shop UI
   kubectl port-forward svc/detector -n demo 8001:8001            # Detector API & metrics (HTTPS)
   kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prom-prometheus -n monitoring 9090 or kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prom-kube-prometheus-prometheus -n monitoring 9090
   kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prom-grafana -n monitoring 3001:80
   ```

   Ensure the detector's `ALLOW_ORIGINS` environment variable includes
   `http://localhost:3005` so the demo-shop UI can reach the API without
   browser CORS errors.

   Verify the API is reachable via HTTPS:

   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:8001/ping
   ```

8. Generate traffic to observe detections:

   ```bash
   python scripts/stuffing.py --score-base https://localhost:8001 --shop-url http://localhost:3005
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If `kubectl port-forward` fails with an error similar to:

```
E... memcache.go:265] "Unhandled Error" err="couldn't get current server API group list: Get \"https://127.0.0.1:60279/api?timeout=32s\": net/http: TLS handshake timeout"
```

the cluster may not be running or `kubectl` is pointing to the wrong context.
Ensure Docker is running and start the kind cluster again with:

```bash
bash infra/kind/up.sh
```

Check that your context is set to `kind-cred-demo` using:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

Once the cluster is up, re-run the port-forward command.

## `/score` endpoint

The backend exposes `POST /score` which accepts a JSON payload:

```json
{ "client_ip": "10.0.0.1", "auth_result": "success" | "failure", "with_jwt": true | false }
```

Include `with_jwt` as `true` when the request uses a JWT access token.

Every call increments the `login_attempts_total` Prometheus counter labelled by IP. When `auth_result` is `failure`, the service counts how many failures have occurred for that IP in the last `FAIL_WINDOW_SECONDS` seconds (60 by default). If the count meets or exceeds `FAIL_LIMIT` (default 5) the request is blocked, an alert row is inserted with `detail` set to "Blocked: too many failures" and the response is:

```json
{ "status": "blocked", "fails_last_minute": <count> }
```

Otherwise it records the failure and returns `{"status": "ok"}`. A successful result simply records the metric.

When `ZERO_TRUST_API_KEY` is enabled, any request missing or providing the wrong
`X-API-Key` header is also counted as a failure via this endpoint so the
dashboard and Prometheus reflect the attempts.

## `/config` endpoint

`GET /config` returns the failure threshold the service is currently using when evaluating login attempts. The value reflects the `FAIL_LIMIT` environment variable or the default of `5`:

```json
{ "fail_limit": 5 }
```

## `/api/security` endpoints

The backend keeps a global `SECURITY_ENABLED` flag (default `true`) controlling
whether failed login attempts trigger blocking. Use `GET /api/security` to
retrieve the current state and `POST /api/security` with a JSON body of
`{"enabled": true|false}` to update it.

When disabled, calls to `/score` will continue to record metrics but will never
return `{"status": "blocked"}`.

When security is enabled the service also expects each request to `/score`
include an `X-Chain-Password` header. This value is derived from the previous
call's password combined with a random nonce. Fetch the current value from
`GET /api/security/chain` and supply it with each request. After validation the
password is rotated so replayed requests are rejected.

## `/api/alerts/stats` endpoint

Authenticated clients can fetch aggregated statistics with `GET /api/alerts/stats`.
The response is a list of objects containing the minute, how many invalid
credential attempts occurred, and how many times blocking was triggered.
These stats power the dashboard chart.

## JWT authentication

Send a `POST` request to `/login` with a JSON body containing a `username` and `password`. If the credentials are valid the response will include a JWT access token:

```json
{"access_token": "<token>", "token_type": "bearer"}
```

Include this token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when calling protected routes such as `/api/alerts`. Token creation and verification happen in `app.core.security`.

### Demonstrating token validation

Run `python scripts/demo_auth.py` after starting the API to see how a valid JWT grants access while a random token is rejected. The script prints the status codes for both attempts and the issued token appears in the server logs thanks to the new middleware.

## User registration

Create an account by sending a `POST` request to `/register` with JSON fields `username` and `password`. The password is securely hashed before storing in the database. After registering, obtain a token from `/login` and include it in `Authorization` headers when calling secured APIs.

## CORS configuration

The backend allows cross-origin requests from `http://localhost:3000` so the React frontend can make authenticated calls without being blocked by the browser's same-origin policy.

## Running the tests

The unit tests live in `backend/tests`. Install the backend requirements and run
pytest from the `backend` directory so the `app` package is discoverable:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

## Edge-hosted monitoring on Raspberry Pi

To run the dashboard directly on a Raspberry Pi, follow the steps in
`rpi/RasberryPiReadme.md`. In short, install the backend and frontend
dependencies, then launch both services to expose the API on port `8001` and the
React UI on port `3000` for any device on your LAN. A convenience script
`python rpi/start_edge_service.py` starts both processes at once.

## Local traffic generation with Mininet

To emulate traffic directly on a Raspberry Pi or other host install
[Mininet](http://mininet.org/) and run the helper script in the `mininet`
directory:

```bash
sudo python3 mininet/gen_traffic.py
```

The script creates two virtual hosts connected by a switch. One host runs a
simple Python HTTP server while the other issues a few baseline requests followed
by a larger burst to mimic attack traffic. After sending the requests you will
be dropped into the Mininet CLI where additional commands such as `pingall` or
`iperf` can be used. Type `exit` to shut down the network.

## On-device ML inference

Capture live packets on the Pi and evaluate them using a TensorFlow model. Place your model file at `training/trained_model.h5` and run:

```bash
python training/run_inference.py --iface eth0
```

## Lightweight SDN controller

Run a small [Ryu](https://osrg.github.io/ryu/) controller to gather OpenFlow
statistics from an Open vSwitch instance. After installing the requirements at
`sdn-controller/requirements.txt`, launch the controller with:

```bash
ryu-manager sdn-controller/simple_monitor.py
```

Point your switch at the Pi's IP on port `6633`. The script logs packet and byte
counts for each active flow. Edit the code to forward these stats to the
detector service if desired.

## SPI display dashboard

Attach a small SPI screen to the Raspberry Pi and render live alert statistics
without opening a browser:

```bash
pip install -r rpi/requirements.txt
python rpi/spi_display.py --api-base http://<pi-ip>:8001
```

The script polls `/api/alerts/stats` and draws the latest values on the display
using `pygame`.

## Performance evaluation

Prometheus scrapes metrics from the detector service at `/metrics`. Use
`scripts/perf_test.py` to send concurrent requests and measure average latency.
Launch the API and then run:

```bash
python scripts/perf_test.py --concurrency 20 --total 200
```

View CPU and memory usage for the on-device model by running
`training/run_inference.py`. Metrics are exported on port `8002` and can be
scraped by Prometheus.

## Touchscreen feature menu

When the Pi has a 3.5" display attached you can launch an interactive menu to
start any of the optional features. The menu works with both a touchscreen and
a keyboard:

```bash
python rpi/menu.py
```

Select a feature to run it and press `Esc` to return to the menu.
