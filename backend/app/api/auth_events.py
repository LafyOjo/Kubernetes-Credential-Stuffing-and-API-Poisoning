# This file is all about logging and retrieving authentication events.
# Whenever someone tries to log in (successfully or not), we capture
# the attempt, enrich it with client details, and push it into both
# the DB (for history) and Prometheus metrics (for monitoring).
# That way, we can track login success/fail trends, detect credential
# stuffing, and measure request latency in real time.
